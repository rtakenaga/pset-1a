		<h4>
			When the team has a ball, they are on offense. The strategy is very important and complicated offensively because that may be their only chance to score a goal! There are several different variations in witch offensive players configure themselves but the main goal is to score goals.
			Read the bullets below to find out more!

		<ul>
				<li>The fowards are usually the ones who do most of the offensive work near the opponents side of the field. Different teams use different formations but in a standard 4-3-3- formation (where there are 4 defenders, 3 midfielders, and 3 fowards), there is a left foward, center foward, and right foward.  </li>
				<li>The wing(Players on the left and right sides)fowards need to be good on their feet and looking for better ways to score. Their skills have to be one of the best for the team in order to succeed in that position. </li>
				<li> Wing players are usually always looking to cross the ball into the goal box in order to score. They also may resort to passing the ball around to get a better angle.
				<li>The center foward should be the best at shooting and should theoretically score most of the goals. Center fowards are usually very fast and can work well in tight spaces. </li>
				<li>The team, Barcelona, uses a technique called Tiki-Taka. This is the name of the play when the players make very small and quick passes to each other to confuse the defenders and find a quick opening to the goal. This move has been proven to be extremely effective, especially in tight spces. Check this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wVoavliLaA">video</a> out to see how they do this play!</li>
				<li>If there are only a few minutes left to the game, the winning team may try to keep possesion instead of trying to score. This insures that the other team will not score and may secure the victory for the winning team. </li>
				<li>Many professional fowards like to celebrate after scoring a goal. After all, this is entertainment!</li>
