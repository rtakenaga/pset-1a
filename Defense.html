		<h4>
			Defense is respnsible for guarding opposing team from scoring and is a key to winning games in soccer. In order to do this, they must be very physical and get the ball from the attackers in an efficient and effective way. The picture shown above is a good example of defending.
		</h4>
		<ul>
				<li>The goal keeper is usually not included in the topic of defense but they are an essential player on the field because they save all of the goals. Goalkeeprs must be fit and have a good reaction time because the ball could be shot from any angle and at any speed. </li>
				<li>In a 4-3-3 formation, there are four defenders: the left defender, center defender, another center defender, and a right defender. </li>
				<li>Defensive position is another part of defense that is vital to be a good defender. The goal of defensive position is to make it difficult for the oppenet to get off a shot. </li>
				<li>To be a good defender, they have to have something called defensive stance. Defensive stance is when the player is slightly crouched and is facing to the side to force the player to go one way. </li>
				<li>Defennders also need to be fit but also strong because it is a very physical position. They need to be able to guard the ball from the opponents. </li>
				<li>Sometimes, a defender may have to resort to clearing the ball to the side lines. Even thought the opponent will gain posession, it delays an attack and gives time for the midfielders to get back. </li>
