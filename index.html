    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>
      The game was created more than 2,000 years ago in ancient China, Greece, and Rome but the English transformed the game into what it is today. They created the main rule of using no hands. As the years passed, the game developed and more rules started to be implemented.
    </p>
    <h1>Overall</h1>
    <p>
Soccer is a great form of exercise and also works out dexterity and balance. Furthermore, the game can be played almost anywhere as long as you have a ball and a flat surface to play on. The feeling of scoring a goal is extremely rewarding and that is why many professionals want to continue their career. When you have the time, definitely try playing some soccer!
